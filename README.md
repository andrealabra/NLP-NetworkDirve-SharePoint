## 📖 Project Overview

This project analyzes **Organizational Change Management (OCM)** survey responses to understand how people feel about upcoming changes.
Using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and the **VADER sentiment analysis algorithm**, we classify responses as **positive 😃**, **neutral 😐**, or **negative 😞**.

The results help identify overall sentiment trends and highlight areas where the change management team can focus their efforts.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Data Cleaning** 🧹 – Preprocess open-ended survey responses.
2. **Sentiment Scoring** 🎯 – Use VADER to score each response.
3. **Classification** 🏷 – Label as **positive**, **neutral**, or **negative** based on score thresholds.
4. **Visualization** 📈 – Create sentiment distribution charts for quick insights.

* ✅ Adjustable **sentiment thresholds** (looser or tighter ranges)
* ✅ Outputs both **counts** and **percentages** for each sentiment category
* ✅ Easy to integrate into dashboards or reports

## 📊 Example Output

**Tighter Sentiment Threshold Results:**

* Positive 😃 – 63 responses
* Neutral 😐 – 149 responses
* Negative 😞 – 48 responses

**Looser Sentiment Threshold Results:**

* Positive 😃 – Higher counts (captures even mild positivity)
* Neutral 😐 – Lower counts (fewer stay neutral)
* Negative 😞 – Higher counts (captures even mild negativity)

## 💡 Insights from the Data

> *“Most users are neutral, with positive feedback outweighing negative — sentiment toward the changes is steady with a lean toward optimism.”*
